# Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help W.Avy and his board of directors understand the ice cream shop market before they invest and expand with their own. W.Avy has asked us to look through a database that includes weather and precipitation historicals for Hawaii. Based on the temperature and weather trends, W.Avy wants to know the best location to build his ice cream shop. He wants to be able to see if his shop will be successful year round, so he has asked us to look at June and December specifically. 

## June Data

## Summary


•	The minimum in June is only 12 degrees warmer than it is in December. This shows that the icecream store would survive in December if the temperature doesn’t get much colder.

•	The average temperature is only 3 degrees warmer in June. Customers can enjoy ice cream at both temperatures: 71 and 74.

•	The number of samples/count is a small difference (1700 for June and 1517 for December) so the data can be compared accurately given that they are similar in population sample size.


# Conclusion

In summary, W.Avy should propose that the business should be opened in Oahu because the variation in temperature is only slight. Customers will be okay with the slight variation. Two other ideas that they could look at is the data from the last 5 years and also they could look at precipitation instead of just the temperature.
